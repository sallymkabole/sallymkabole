### 👋 Hey there, I’m Sally!

I'm a **software engineer turned data scientist** who believes tech should make life better — not just smarter.

🚀 I specialize in turning complex data into meaningful, human-centered solutions.  
🎓 Recently graduated from **Carnegie Mellon University** (yay!), where I focused on **AI, NLP**, and all things **machine learning**.  
💡 I’m passionate about **responsible AI**, especially in healthcare, ethics, and tech-for-good initiatives.

If your project sits at the intersection of code, people, and impact — I’m in!
